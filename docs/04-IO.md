```purescript
// Recursive must be true for directories
const options = { recursive: true, force: false }

let copyOptions = { recursive: Just true, foce: Just false }

IO.cp { source: "path/to/directory", dest: "path/to/dest", options: Just copyOptions }
IO.mv { source: "path/to/file", dest: "path/to/dest" }
